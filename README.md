  CODE OVERVIEW
This GitHub repository consists of two main folders: Preprocessing and Analysis. Here is a brief overview of each folder and its contents:  
  
  Preprocessing Folder:
This folder contains a script that outlines the fundamental steps for preprocessing raw WFOM data.  
  
  Analysis Folder:
Within this folder, you can find codes related to conducting correlation analysis and non-negative least squares fits on the preprocessed WFOM data. The analysis is divided into five consecutive steps, where each step relies on the results of the previous step(s). It indicates that the analysis is iterative and builds upon the outcomes of earlier stages.
To ensure the successful execution of these analysis steps, it is important to add the "Auxiliary_Codes" folder to the MATLAB path.
